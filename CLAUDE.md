# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the **Engineering Fidelity Paper** - a technical measurement science paper on CPR manikin characterization.

**Target:** Measurement Science and Technology - Special Issue on "Data-Centric Exploration and Explanation of Physical and Engineering Phenomena"

**Deadline:** March 31, 2026

## Core Concept

Build a **human reference model** from medical/clinical literature for both chest compressions and ventilations, then systematically compare multiple CPR training manikins against that model to quantify the "engineering fidelity gap."

## Key Files

- `MST_paper_outline.md` - Detailed paper outline
- `MST_paper_supervisor_summary.md` - Summary for supervisors

## Related Repositories

- **Proposition** (https://github.com/jakorten/Proposition.git) - Perspective paper on engineering fidelity framework
- This paper provides the **technical methodology**; the Proposition paper provides the **conceptual framework**

## Build Commands

TBD - LaTeX setup to be added when paper writing begins.
