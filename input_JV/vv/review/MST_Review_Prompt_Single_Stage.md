## Critical Evaluation Criteria

Evaluate the manuscript on these dimensions using a 1-5 scale:
- **5 = Excellent:** Exceeds MST standards, strong fit for special issue
- **4 = Good:** Meets MST standards, minor improvements possible
- **3 = Acceptable:** Meets minimum standards, moderate revisions needed
- **2 = Needs Improvement:** Below standards, major revisions required
- **1 = Unacceptable:** Does not meet MST standards

### 1. DATA-CENTRIC CONTRIBUTION (Weight: 20%)

**Evaluate:**
- Is the contribution built on systematic data collection and analysis?
- Does it provide novel insights from data (not just data presentation)?
- Is the data-driven methodology clearly explained?
- Are datasets described with sufficient detail?
- Could the approach be applied to other physical phenomena?

**Red Flags:**
- Data presented without systematic analysis
- No clear insight derived from data
- Methodology not generalizable
- Data quality/provenance unclear

### 2. PHYSICS-INFORMED MODELING (Weight: 15%)

**Evaluate:**
- Is the work grounded in physical/biomechanical principles?
- Are physical models appropriate for the phenomena studied?
- Is the connection between model and physical reality clear?
- Are model assumptions justified and limitations acknowledged?
- Does the model provide explanatory power (not just fitting)?

**Red Flags:**
- Purely empirical fitting without physical basis
- Model assumptions unjustified
- Physical principles misapplied
- No connection to underlying phenomena

### 3. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY (Weight: 15%)

**Evaluate:**
- Is the measurement approach novel or significantly improved?
- Are measurement principles sound and appropriate?
- Is the instrumentation adequately described?
- Are calibration procedures documented?
- Is traceability to standards established where appropriate?

**Red Flags:**
- Standard methods without novel contribution
- Measurement principles incorrect
- Instrumentation inadequately described
- No calibration documentation

### 4. UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION (Weight: 15%)

**Evaluate:**
- Are uncertainty sources identified and quantified?
- Is the uncertainty analysis methodology sound (GUM or equivalent)?
- Are both random and systematic uncertainties addressed?
- Is combined/expanded uncertainty reported appropriately?
- Are uncertainty budgets presented clearly?

**Red Flags:**
- Only standard deviation reported
- No uncertainty budget
- Systematic uncertainties ignored
- Unrealistically small uncertainties

### 5. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & STATISTICAL METHODS (Weight: 10%)

**Evaluate:**
- Is the experimental design appropriate for research questions?
- Are sample sizes adequate and justified?
- Are statistical methods appropriate for the data?
- Are controls adequate and confounding addressed?
- Are assumptions verified (normality, independence)?

### 6. ORIGINALITY & SIGNIFICANCE (Weight: 10%)

**Evaluate:**
- How novel is the approach or findings?
- Does it advance beyond existing methods significantly?
- Are the findings significant for the measurement community?
- Is the novelty clearly articulated?

### 7. CLARITY & ORGANIZATION (Weight: 10%)

**Evaluate:**
- Is the structure logical (problem → gap → contribution → results)?
- Can the main contribution be stated in one sentence?
- Are methods described with appropriate detail?
- Do results emphasize key findings?
- Does discussion interpret (not repeat) results?

### 8. REPRODUCIBILITY (Weight: 5%)

**Evaluate:**
- Can others replicate the methodology?
- Are equipment specifications complete?
- Is data/code availability addressed?
- Are procedures described with sufficient detail?
