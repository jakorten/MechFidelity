CLAIM VERIFICATION SUMMARY
MST Paper: Mechanical Fidelity of CPR Training Manikins
Date: 2026-01-15
Scope: Infant VENTILATION only (compression out of scope - no human stiffness/damping data)

==============================================================================
COVERAGE: 9/12 in-scope claims verified (75%)
P0 Critical: 6/7 verified (86%) - Remaining P0 blocked by own experiments
==============================================================================

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
-----------------------
[x] I2: No systematic manikin benchmark exists
    Source: Literature gap confirmed. Only Baubin 1995 (30y old). Recent work
    (Lim 2024, Morin 2024) develops single manikins, not benchmarks.

[x] I3: First infant ventilation reference model for manikin benchmarking
    Source: No competing infant ventilation manikin benchmark found.


SECTION 2: HUMAN REFERENCE MODEL - VENTILATION (IN SCOPE)
---------------------------------------------------------
[x] V1: Infant compliance ~78-171 mL/kPa (age-dependent)
    Source: Huang 2016 (n=205 infants, 1-96 weeks)
    Values: 1-24 wks: 77.95 +/- 46.16 mL/kPa
            73-96 wks: 170.58 +/- 50.14 mL/kPa

[x] V2: Infant resistance ~6.4-3.7 kPa/L/s (decreases with age)
    Source: Huang 2016 (n=205)
    Values: 1-24 wks: median 6.39 kPa/L/s
            73-96 wks: median 3.74 kPa/L/s

[x] V3: Infant chest wall ~3x more compliant than lungs
    Source: Stoecklin 2024 (n=23 preterm), Diedericks 2025 (review)
    Values: Ccw/kg 3.0 vs CL/kg 0.95 mL/cmH2O/kg
    Note: Ratio normalizes by ~1 year (rib ossification)


SECTION 7: DISCUSSION
---------------------
[x] D1: First systematic multi-manikin ventilation benchmark
    Source: Literature gap confirmed - no multi-manikin benchmark against
    human reference values exists

[x] D2: Ventilation fidelity is novel contribution
    Source: Reiss 2015 calls for manikin C/R characterization but none exists


==============================================================================
COMPRESSION - OUT OF SCOPE (verified but not benchmarkable)
==============================================================================
Why out of scope: No human stiffness/damping data exists for infants.
We have depth targets but cannot benchmark force-displacement behavior.

[x] C5: Infant chest properties largely uncharacterized
    Source: Babic 2017 - "Little research has been performed to evaluate
    the force required in younger infants"
    -> This GAP is why compression is out of scope

[x] C7: Infant compression depth targets exist (Japan 2024)
    Values: 0mo: 2.7cm, 2mo: 2.9cm, 12-23mo: 3.6cm
    Note: Depth only - no force/stiffness data to benchmark against


==============================================================================
CLAIMS BLOCKED BY OWN WORK (experiments pending)
==============================================================================
[ ] M1: Protocol based on IEEE TIM methodology
[ ] M2: Multiple manufacturers tested
[ ] RV1-RV3: Manikin ventilation values and deviation from human reference

CONTEXT SOURCES (compression - out of scope):
- Japan CC 2024: n=555 - depth targets only, no stiffness
- Babic 2017: confirms evidence gap


==============================================================================
NOTES
==============================================================================
- DR-001 DECIDED: Infant ventilation ONLY
  Rationale: No human stiffness/damping data for infant compression
  -> Cannot benchmark manikin compression without reference values
- All infant ventilation claims (V1-V3) directly verified from source PDFs
- No hallucinations detected in verified claims
- Next: Bronkhorst discussion re airway pressure sensor
