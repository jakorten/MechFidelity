COVERAGE: 12/23 claims verified (52%)
P0 Critical: 11/15 verified (73%) - Remaining P0 blocked by own experiments
==============================================================================

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
-----------------------
[x] I2: No systematic manikin benchmark exists
    Source: Literature gap confirmed. Only Baubin 1995 (30y old). Recent work
    (Lim 2024, Morin 2024) develops single manikins, not benchmarks.

[x] I3: First combined compression + ventilation reference model
    Source: No competing combined model found in literature.


SECTION 2: HUMAN REFERENCE MODEL - COMPRESSION
----------------------------------------------
[x] C1: Adult chest stiffness 4-10 N/mm (human)
    Source: Nysaether 2008 (n=59 OHCA patients)
    Values: Mean 270 +/- 150 N at 38mm -> ~7 N/mm average

[x] C2: Adult chest damping ~0.17 N*s/mm (human)
    Source: Nysaether 2008 (n=59)
    Values: 169 +/- 60 N*s/m

[x] C3: Force-displacement is non-linear
    Source: Tomlinson 2007 (n=91)
    Values: Progressivity factor 1.41 +/- 0.25

[x] C4: Stiffness decreases ~35% after 3000 compressions (P1)
    Source: Ruiz de Gauna 2023 (n=615, 1.15M compressions)
    Values: 34.6% decrease (95% CI 33.0-36.1)

[x] C5: Infant chest properties largely uncharacterized
    Source: Babic 2017 - "Little research has been performed to evaluate
    the force required in younger infants"

[x] C7: Infant compression depth targets are age-dependent
    Source: Japan 2024 (n=555 critically ill patients <8 years)
    Values: 0 months: 2.7 cm (2.5-2.9)
            2 months: 2.9 cm (2.7-3.2)
            12-23 months: 3.6 cm (3.4-4.0)
    Note: 49% of infants 0-2mo would be over-compressed using 4cm guideline


SECTION 2: HUMAN REFERENCE MODEL - VENTILATION
----------------------------------------------
[x] V1: Infant compliance ~78-171 mL/kPa (age-dependent)
    Source: Huang 2016 (n=205 infants, 1-96 weeks)
    Values: 1-24 wks: 77.95 +/- 46.16 mL/kPa
            73-96 wks: 170.58 +/- 50.14 mL/kPa

[x] V2: Infant resistance ~6.4-3.7 kPa/L/s (decreases with age)
    Source: Huang 2016 (n=205)
    Values: 1-24 wks: median 6.39 kPa/L/s
            73-96 wks: median 3.74 kPa/L/s

[x] V3: Infant chest wall ~3x more compliant than lungs
    Source: Stoecklin 2024 (n=23 preterm), Diedericks 2025 (review)
    Values: Ccw/kg 3.0 vs CL/kg 0.95 mL/cmH2O/kg
    Note: Ratio normalizes by ~1 year (rib ossification)


SECTION 7: DISCUSSION
---------------------
[x] D1: First systematic multi-manikin benchmark
    Source: Literature gap confirmed - no multi-manikin benchmark against
    human reference values exists

[x] D2: Ventilation fidelity is novel contribution
    Source: Reiss 2015 calls for manikin C/R characterization but none exists
