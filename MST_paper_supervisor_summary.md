# MST Paper Opportunity - Summary for Supervisors

**Date:** January 2026

---

## Opportunity

Special issue of **Measurement Science and Technology** (IOP Publishing) on *"Data-Centric Exploration and Explanation of Physical and Engineering Phenomena"*

**Deadline:** March 31, 2026 (~2.5 months)

**Link:** https://iopscience.iop.org/collections/mst-251119-1003

## Proposed Paper

**Title:** "Engineering Fidelity of CPR Training Manikins: A Data-Driven Reference Model for Chest Compression and Ventilation Mechanics"

**Core idea:**
1. Build a human reference model from medical literature (chest mechanics + respiratory mechanics)
2. Systematically test multiple CPR manikins against this reference
3. Quantify the "engineering fidelity gap" for each manikin

## Why This Paper?

| Strength | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Novel contribution** | First systematic benchmark combining compression AND ventilation fidelity |
| **Ventilation gap** | Compression mechanics have some literature; ventilation mechanics are almost unstudied |
| **Data-driven** | Fits special issue theme; reference model built from published clinical data |
| **Actionable** | Produces procurement-relevant fidelity metrics |
| **Synergy** | Complements perspective paper (Resuscitation) and TIM sensor validation work |

---

## Resources Available

- ✓ Multiple manikins (different models + replicates)
- ✓ Force-displacement measurement apparatus (from TIM work)
- ✓ Human reference data for compressions (Tomlinson, Lim, Ruiz de Gauna)
- ✓ Human reference data for ventilations (Huang, Battisti)
- ✓ Flow/pressure measurement capability for ventilation testing

## Timeline

| Period | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| Jan | Data collection |
| Feb | Analysis + modeling |
| Early Mar | Writing + co-author feedback |
| Mid-Late Mar | Revision + submit |

## Fit with Publication Strategy

```
IEEE TIM (under review)     → Sensor validation methodology
IEEE THMS (under review)    → Training effectiveness (RCT)
Resuscitation (in prep)     → Conceptual framework (perspective)
MST (proposed)              → Technical benchmark methodology ← NEW
```

The perspective paper argues *for* engineering fidelity; the MST paper provides the *tools to measure* it.

## Decision Needed

1. Is the 2.5-month timeline feasible given current commitments?
2. Is ventilation testing equipment available/acquirable?
3. Priority relative to other ongoing work?

---

## Recommendation

This is a strong opportunity if resources permit. The ventilation fidelity angle is unique and directly addresses the major gap identified in our perspective paper. The special issue framing (data-centric, physics-informed) aligns well with our measurement science approach.

Risk: very tight timeline (2.5 months). Mitigation: leverage existing TIM methodology, available manikins, and focus scope if needed.
