NOTE FOR COLLEAGUE
==================
Date: 2026-01-15

SCOPE CHANGE: Infant Ventilation Only
-------------------------------------

DR-001 has been decided: We are focusing on INFANT VENTILATION only.
Compression is OUT OF SCOPE.

WHY?
----
- No human stiffness/damping data exists for infant chests
- Japan 2024 gives depth targets (2.7-4.0 cm) but NO force data
- Babic 2017 confirms: "Little research has been performed to evaluate
  the force required in younger infants"
- Without human reference values, we cannot benchmark manikin compression

We HAVE strong human reference data for infant ventilation:
- Huang 2016: n=205 infants, compliance 78-171 mL/kPa, resistance 3.7-6.4 kPa/L/s
- Stoecklin 2024: n=23 preterm, Ccw/CL ratio ~3:1
- Diedericks 2025: confirms Ccw ~3x CL in neonates

IMPLICATIONS
------------
- Load cell firmware integration: DEPRIORITIZED
- Focus: Airway pressure sensor (discuss with Bronkhorst re EL-PRESS P-506C)
- Alternative: MPXV5010DP (~10 EUR) + water column reference

FILES NEEDING UPDATE
--------------------
These still say "compression + ventilation" - need revision:
- MST_paper_outline.md
- paper_draft.md
- MST_paper_supervisor_summary.md

See backlog.md and DR-001_reference_model_scope.md for full rationale.

CLAIM VERIFICATION STATUS
-------------------------
See: input_JV/claim_verification_summary.txt
- 75% of in-scope claims verified (9/12)
- P0 at 86% (6/7)
- Remaining claims blocked by our own experiments

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Discuss Bronkhorst EL-PRESS P-506C for traceable airway pressure
2. Inventory available infant manikins (DR-002)
3. Update paper structure to ventilation-only scope
