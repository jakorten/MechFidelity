**Subject:** Data request: Neonatal piglet chest compression force-displacement data

Dear Dr. Schmölzer,

I am writing regarding your recent publication "Comparison of hemodynamic effects of chest compression delivered via machine or human in asphyxiated piglets" (Pediatric Research, 2024) and related work from your group on neonatal CPR using the mechanical chest compression device.

**Our research context:**

We are developing an engineering fidelity framework for infant CPR training manikins at HAN University of Applied Sciences (Netherlands), in collaboration with clinical partners at WKZ (Wilhelmina Children's Hospital) and LUMC. Our goal is to establish reference mechanical properties (stiffness, damping) against which infant manikins can be objectively evaluated.

**The gap we've identified:**

While human infant ventilation mechanics are well-characterized in the literature (e.g., Huang 2016), there is a critical gap in infant chest compression mechanical properties. Ethical constraints prevent direct measurement on human infants, making animal surrogate data essential.

**Our request:**

Your neonatal piglet model (2.12 ± 0.17 kg, 0-3 days old) closely matches term infant weight and has been validated for CPR research. We noted in your paper the statement: "the force used to compress the chest contributes significantly to the stroke volume and left ventricular function during CC."

We would like to know:

1. Did your mechanical CC device record compression **force** in addition to depth during these experiments?

2. If so, would you be willing to share the raw force-displacement data? We would calculate chest stiffness (k = ΔF/Δd) and damping coefficients - parameters not currently reported in the neonatal literature.

3. Alternatively, if force was not recorded, does your mechanical CC device have force sensing capability for future studies?

**What we offer:**

- Full acknowledgment/co-authorship as appropriate
- Shared analysis results and methodology
- Potential for ongoing collaboration on neonatal CPR device evaluation

**Our timeline:**

We are targeting submission to Measurement Science and Technology (Special Issue on Data-Centric Exploration) by March 2026, but this collaboration would have value beyond that specific publication.

I would be happy to provide more details about our research or discuss this further via video call.

Thank you for considering this request.

Kind regards,
