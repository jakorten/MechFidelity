Abstract
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation manikins are used for training personnel in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
State-of-the-art cardiopulmonary resuscitation manikins are still anatomically and physiologically low-fidelity designs. The
aim of this research was to design a manikin that offers high anatomical and physiological fidelity and has a cardiac and
respiratory system along with integrated flow sensors to monitor cardiac output and air displacement in response to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This manikin was designed in accordance with anatomical dimensions using a polyoxymethylene rib cage connected to a vertebral column from an anatomical female model. The respiratory system was composed of silicon-coated memory foam mimicking lungs, a polyvinylchloride bronchus and a latex trachea. The
cardiovascular system was composed of two sets of latex tubing representing the pulmonary and aortic arteries which
were connected to latex balloons mimicking the ventricles and lumped abdominal volumes, respectively. These balloons
were filled with Life/form simulation blood and placed inside polyether foam. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems
were equipped with flow sensors to gather data in response to chest compressions. Three non-medical professionals
performed chest compressions on this manikin yielding data corresponding to force–displacement while the flow sensors provided feedback. The force–displacement tests on this manikin show a desirable nonlinear behaviour mimicking
chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans. In addition, the flow sensors provide valuable data
on the internal effects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In conclusion, scientifically designed and anatomically highfidelity designs of cardiopulmonary resuscitation manikins that embed flow sensors can improve physiological fidelity and
provide useful feedback data.

Introduction
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency
procedure performed on patients during cardiac and
respiratory arrest. This procedure externally activates
the cardiac and respiratory systems via the delivery of
chest compressions and artificial ventilation (e.g. rescue
breathing). These actions aim at delivering oxygen to
vital organs until spontaneous circulation and breathing can be restored.
Multiple organisations such as the American Health
Association (AHA)1 provide guidelines for performing
CPR. For adults, these guidelines recommend a thoracic compression depth of 5 cm or more at the centre
of the sternum at a rate of at least 100 compressions
per minute (CPM). These guidelines also recommend
administering two rescue breaths (with a visible chestrise) per 30 chest compressions. In order to train

personnel in performing CPR, surrogate patients in the
form of manikins are used.
Ideally, manikins should be designed based on an
understanding of the physiological and mechanical
effects of administering CPR with the aim of increasing
realism during training so that clinical performance of
CPR administration can be improved. Not surprisingly,
the current fields of research in the design of CPR manikins include the following: theoretical foundations of
simulation in healthcare,2,3 physiological modelling of
the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,4–6 force–
displacement testing of the human thorax,7–9 enhancing
tactile experience of CPR manikins,10 effectiveness of
using simulation in clinical practice11–13 and incorporating clinical recommendations for manikin design.14
Despite the aforementioned recommendations and a
clinical desire for physiologically and anatomically
high-fidelity manikin designs, even the technologically
most advanced manikins such as the SimMan 3G
(Laerdal,
Stavanger,
Norway)
and
Apollo
(CAE
healthcare, Sarasota, FL, USA) do not fulfil all these
requirements. This is partly due to the fact that like
other classical designs, these manikins consist of a single spring–damper configuration, as
illustrated in
Figure 1(a), where the spring is represented by the diagonal stripes and the damper by the yellow cylinder. The
behaviour of the spring with spring constant k1 is that
a vertical force F leads to a vertical displacement Dz1
= F/k1 (Figure 1(b)). This displacement is independent
of the axial location (Figure 1(c)) of the applied force
since the manikin sternum is stiff and does not tilt, a
behaviour unrealistic when compared to the human
body. Furthermore, while most classical manikins offer
depth detection and the rate of chest compression,
thereby providing information on the adherence to
CPR guidelines, they provide no feedback on the physiological and mechanical effects of performing CPR,
for example, oxygen saturation and cardiac output.
There is a key clinical demand for CPR manikins to
mimic human physiology and monitor cardiac output,
artificial ventilation and oxygen saturation in order to
provide feedback data for assessing CPR performance.15,16 This requires manikins to have an actual
cardiovascular and respiratory system, within which
necessary sensors can be embedded. In addition, manikins need an anatomically correct skeletal structure to
increase tactile realism. A design that would incorporate these features will provide additional value over
the existing designs since clinicians will be able to
titrate their CPR actions in order to fulfil physiological
demands.
This article details the design of such a manikin that
incorporates an anatomically realistic thorax including
a cardiovascular and respiratory system with integrated
flow sensors for monitoring their output. Furthermore,
we compare the force–displacement performance of our
design to that of humans and classical manikin designs.
Finally, we compare the cardiac output, as measured
by the embedded sensors, to physiological and clinical
studies.
Materials and methods
Modelling the thorax
In Figure 2(a), we show a theoretical improvement over
a single spring–damper manikin configuration (Figure
1(a)). For the purpose of illustration, a configuration of

manikin, (b) chest compression at a location left of centre and

examples of compression, Dz1 = Dz2 which is unrealistic when
compared to the human body.

three spring–dampers is shown. A configuration of an
infinite number of such spring–dampers would closely
mimic the human thorax. In such a set-up, the spring
behaviour of the thorax is dependent on the location of
the force. The same force applied at different locations
will lead to different displacements (Figure 2(b) and
(c)), Dz16¼Dz2.
In Figure 3(a), we depict the human body in anatomical detail consisting of a flexible sternum/rib cage
along with a respiratory and cardiovascular system.
Grey depicts the spinal column to which the rib cage
(yellow) is attached. The respiratory (blue) and cardiovascular (red) systems are present within the rib cage.
The blood vessels in the cardiovascular system are
lumped into cranial and abdominal blood volumes
(shown as two red circles at the far ends of the body).
The green area depicts the abdomen. Figure 3(b) and
(c) depicts the internal effects occurring as a result of
chest compressions. The effects of compression are
position-dependent (clearly visible) and also modulate
cardiac output.17
The manikin constructed for this research (Figure 4)
was designed by combining the models as shown in
Figures 2 and 3. Here, the rib cage, respiratory and cardiovascular systems mimic a configuration of multiple
spring–damper systems. The next section details the
design of this manikin.
Design of the new manikin and integration of sensors
As a foundation for the manikin design, a vertebral column (78 cm in height from pelvis to C1 vertebra) from
an anatomical female model (vertebral column for the
demonstration of malpositions; Erler-Zimmer, Lauf,
Germany) was used. The rib cage of this model was
removed and copied on a 1:1 scale using the software
Illustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). This drawing
was cut using a Speedy 300 laser engraver (Trotec,
Canton, MI, USA) from a sheet of polyoxymethylene
(POM) material (dimensions: 700 mm 3 400 mm 3 4
mm). The rib cage was bent into an anatomically correct shape using heat (Figure 5(a)) and the original reference model removed from the vertebral column. This
rib cage was then socketed and bolted to the T1–T10
vertebrae of the skeletal model’s spine (Figure 5(b)).
The motivation for choosing POM was the expectation
of forceful compressions,18 and it was chosen for its
high stiffness property. In addition, POM has a high
abrasion resistance and resilience to repeated load19
which are necessary material qualities for a model subjected to sustained compressions.
A respiratory system (lungs, bronchus and trachea)
was created and embedded within this rib cage. The
lungs were built using polyurethane (PU) memory
foam (density, r = 45 kg/m3). This material was chosen to mimic the porous structure of lung tissue.20–22
Two foam blocks were carved into the anatomic shape
(Figure 6) of lungs and coated with a layer of Ecoflex
00-30 silicon (Smooth-On, Macungie, PA, USA) to create closed chambers. These chambers were attached to
bronchi made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), which in
turn were connected to a trachea made of a latex tube
(inner diameter, 2 cm). This trachea ended in the oral
cavity of the manikin.
In addition to the respiratory system, a cardiovascular system was constructed and embedded within this
rib cage. The system contained two sets of latex tubing
(inner diameter, 1 cm) representing the pulmonary and
aortic arteries. The four ends of these tubes were connected to latex balloons (Figure 6), two mimicking ventricles and two mimicking lumped abdominal blood
volumes. All balloons were filled with 75 mL of Life/
form simulation blood (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI,
USA). This volume correlates with the average blood
volume present in the ventricles of the female human
body.23 Both ventricles were inserted into a twopocketed single polyether (PE) foam (density, r = 25
kg/m3) model representing the heart walls (Figure
7(a)). The heart model was placed inside the thorax,
between the fourth and seventh rib, along the coronal
cardiac axis of 45 slightly left of the sternum.

The respiratory and cardiovascular systems were
equipped with flow sensors to gather data in response
to chest compressions. An AMW720P1 airflow sensor
(Honeywell, Morris Plains, NJ, USA) was embedded
into the trachea. Two Vision 2000 flow sensors (B.I.OTECH, Vilshofen, Germany) were embedded in the
aortic and pulmonary arteries (Figure 6). An Arduino
Uno microprocessor platform was used (ARDUINO
LLC, Somerville, MA, USA) for collecting and processing the data from sensors. These data were displayed on
a laptop (Figure 6) in real-time using Processing software (Creative Commons, Mountain View, CA, USA).
The manikin was completed by incorporating a wooden head and foam-based musculature for the neck,
shoulders, abdominal wall and thighs, respectively. The
abdominal musculature was created to secure the thoracic organs (Figure 7(a)) while the other body parts
were created to improve the aesthetics of the manikin.
Finally, a stretch-textile cover (skin) and POM faceplate were created to secure all parts of the manikin in
place (Figure 7(b)).

Test set-up
In order to estimate the mechanical behaviour of the
thorax, force–displacement tests were performed on the
CPR manikin using the Q-CPR measurement and feedback tool (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Three
non-medical professionals performed a series of 30-s
long chest compressions on the manikin. These compressions were performed in conformance with the
AHA guidelines for speed and compression depth. The
force of compressions in Newton and the depth of thoracic displacement (in cm) were measured with respect to
time and were analysed using MATLAB (MathWorks,
Natick, MA, USA). For one of the force–displacement
tests, cardiac output and ventilation volume were captured using the embedded sensors. These sensors measured air displacement and ventricular blood flow.
These sensor data were captured using the Arduino
microcontroller and displayed using Processing.
Comparing force–displacement data with existing
research
The results of the force–displacement tests, as obtained
in our test set-up, were compared with the results of
thoracic displacement research on typical humans and
typical classical CPR manikins as reported by Gruben
and colleagues.7–9 In their study, Gruben et al. fit a
polynomial equation to their data as follows
F ¼ Fe þ Fd
ð1Þ
Fe ¼ kðzÞ  z
ð2Þ
kðzÞ ¼ k1 þ k2  z þ k3  z2 þ k4  z3
ð3Þ
Fd ¼ mðzÞ  _z
ð4Þ
mðzÞ ¼ d0 þ d1  z
ð5Þ
where the compression force F consists of an elastic
component, Fe, and a damping component, Fd (equation (1)). The elastic component (Fe) is nonlinear since
the stiffness coefficient, k(z), is dependent on displacement (equations (2) and (3)). The damping component
(Fd) depends on the damping coefficient m(z) (equations
(4) and (5)) which is also dependent on displacement.
Gruben et al. estimated k(z) and m(z) by fitting them
to polynomials of four and two coefficients, respectively, as shown in equation (6)
F ¼ k1  z þ k2  z2 þ k3  z3 þ k4  z4 þ d0 _z þ d1  z  _z
ð6Þ
The results of the compression force and the resulting vertical displacement (depth), as obtained from our
tests, were fit to the above equation using the linear
least squares method.
Comparing flow sensor data with existing research
We report the average cardiac output and air displacement (L/min) as measured by flow sensors in response
to chest compressions. These data are compared to the
physiological model of Koeken et al.6 which was developed to investigate the cardiac output during CPR.
Since the ventricular volumes of the manikin developed
in this research (150 mL) and those of Koeken et al.
(262 mL) are different, we proportionally scale the cardiac output obtained. Furthermore, the results of cardiac output are also compared with those of Fodden et
al.24 who estimated the cardiac output using Doppler
ultrasound during CPR in humans.
Results
Comparing results of force–displacement
Figure 8 shows the force–displacement graphs for the
typical classical manikins (red), typical humans (blue)
as well as the manikin designed in this research (black).
Each curve consists of the elastic component (compression) and the damping component (release). The areas
under the curve correspond to the energy transmitted
into the manikin/body during chest compressions (the
work (W)). As the compression depth approaches 5 cm
(as required by the AHA guidelines), our manikin
shows a desirable nonlinear behaviour mimicking that
of humans (blue). However, the force required to reach
similar compression depths is considerably lower.
Comparing results obtained from sensor data
Figure 9 shows the cardiac output of the left (blue) and
right (green) ventricle as well as the air displacement
volume (red) during 18 consecutive chest compressions
performed at 120 CPM in conformance with the AHA
guidelines. The total cardiac output was found to be
1.65 L/min, 0.92 L/min in the left ventricle and 0.73 L/
min in the right ventricle. As opposed to the model of
Figure 8. The force–displacement graphs for a typical classical
manikin (red), the typical human (blue) and the manikin designed
in this research (black). As the compression depth approaches 5
cm (as required by the AHA guidelines), our manikin shows a
desirable nonlinear behaviour mimicking that seen in humans.

Koeken et al.,6 we found a 43% higher cardiac output
in our manikin. After scaling the cardiac output based
on ventricular size, the cardiac output increased to 2.88
L/min, which is 150% higher. The cardiac output of
1.65 L/min in our manikin is 48% lower than that estimated
by
Fodden
et
al.24
in
human
beings.
Furthermore, the air displacement as measured in the
trachea of our manikin during chest compressions was
2.7 L/min.
Discussion
This article details the design of a novel CPR manikin
that anatomically mimics human beings. This humanlike construction allows for the embodiment of vital
organs within which flow sensors are integrated in
order to measure cardiac output and air displacement.
The novelty of this design is the anatomical design and
construction of the manikin with the expectation that
improving physical fidelity increases functional fidelity
as showcased by Sawyer et al.13 in training simulators
for intubation. The embodiment of flow sensors within
the organs permits internal monitoring during CPR
performance for which there is a strong clinical need.14
This biofeedback is expected to enhance understanding
of the internal effects of performing CPR in terms of
adequacy of ventilation and blood flow.
The force–displacement tests carried out to understand the mechanical behaviour of the thorax show that
as the compression depth approaches 5 cm (as required
by the AHA guidelines), the manikin designed in our
research exhibits a desirable nonlinear behaviour as
seen in humans. Our manikin, unlike typical manikins,
shows a greater nonlinear relationship since the polynomial estimate of the force–displacement relationship
(equation (6)) has three non-zero higher order components (k2, k3 and k4) while the typical manikin has only
one higher order component (k2).9
However, the force required to achieve similar compression depths in humans is considerably higher.9 This
indicates that the stiffness of our manikin is low. The
stiffness can be improved using an alternative material
for the rib cage (e.g. fibreglass-coated ribs), increasing
the thickness of the rib cage and/or using a foam of
higher density for lungs. Developing a thicker rib cage
was
restricted
by
our
manufacturing
constraints
(Speedy 300 laser engraver) while higher density foams
mimicking the density of lung tissue25 are unavailable.
The energy transmitted into the manikin (the work
(W)) can be increased by enhancing the damping coefficient of the thorax which can be facilitated by connecting the lungs to the rib cage, that is, mimicking the
pleural cavity and implementing flow restrictions. This,
in addition to an increased stiffness, will mimic the
force–displacement behaviour of human thorax more
closely.
The flow sensors measuring cardiac output and air
displacement during CPR provide useful data since the
CPR trainee can immediately view the effects of their
actions. The cardiac output data generated here are
48% lower than that measured by Fodden et al.24 while
being 150% higher than expected from physiological
modelling.6 Likely, our results differ from those of
Fodden et al. since their population was 70% male with
potentially higher ventricular volumes, than our modelled subject who was female. In addition, less energy
was transmitted into the thorax of the manikin during
chest compressions, as can be seen from the force–
displacement curves in Figure 8. The cardiac output of
this manikin can be increased using larger latex balloons to mimic the ventricles and using latex tubing of
a greater diameter to represent the pulmonary and aortic arteries. However, there is a need for conclusive clinical data on the cardiac output of humans during CPR
before models can simulate physiologically realistic cardiac outputs.
This design also has some limitations. For example,
it can be improved by employing materials that mimic
the mechanical properties of human tissues more
closely. The challenge herein is that the materials not
only need to have suitable material properties but
should also be amiable to the rigours of manufacturing
processes such as laser cutting, heat shaping and injection moulding. The design is also limited by the absence
of valves and the lack of connection between pulmonary
and
systemic
circulations.
These
limitations

notwithstanding, this design makes important steps
towards making the design of manikins more realistic
and in improving anatomical and physiological fidelity.
Conclusion
This study details a scientifically designed novel manikin design that integrates cardiac and respiratory systems and offers increased anatomical and physiological
fidelity. In response to CPR, this manikin shows a
desirable nonlinear behaviour in its force–displacement
curve, as is also seen in human beings. Furthermore,
internal flow sensors monitoring cardiac output and air
displacement provide valuable feedback.
